# Pattern Matching

## Chapter Goals

This chapter will introduce two new concepts: algebraic data types, and pattern matching. Pattern matching is a common technique in functional programming and allows the developer to write compact code which expresses potentially complex ideas. Algebraic data types are a feature of the PureScript type system which allow similar expressiveness in the language of types - they are closely related to pattern matching.

The goal of the chapter will be to write a library to describe and manipulate simple vector graphics.

## Project Setup

Create a new project with the following Bower dependencies:

- `purescript-globals`
- `purescript-math`
- `purescript-arrays`
- `purescript-foldable-traversable`

Also create a new module called `Data.Picture`:

```
module Data.Picture where

import Data.Foldable
```

## Simple Pattern Matching

Let's begin by looking at an example. Here is a function which computes the greatest common divisor of two integers using pattern matching:

```
gcd :: Number -> Number -> Number
gcd n 0 = n
gcd 0 n = n
gcd n m = if n > m then gcd (n - m) m else gcd n (m - n)
```

This algorithm is called the Euclidean Algorithm. If you search for its definition online, you will likely find a set of mathematical equations which look a lot like the code above. This is one benefit of pattern matching: it allows you to define code by cases, writing simple, declarative code which looks like a specification of a mathematical function.

A function written using pattern matching works by pairing sets of conditions with their results. The expressions on the left of the equals sign are called patterns, and describe which conditions the arguments must satisfy before the alternative on the right of the equals sign should be evaluated and returned. Each alternative is tried in order, and the first alternative whose patterns match their inputs determines the return value.

For example, the first line states that if the second argument is zero, then the result is just the value of the first argument.

Note that patterns can bind values to names - each line in the example binds one or both of the names `n` and `m` to the input values. As we learn about different kinds of patterns, we will see that different types of patterns correspond to different ways to choose names from the input arguments.

The example code above demonstrates two types of patterns:

- Numeric literals patterns, which match something of type `Number`, only if the value matches exactly.
- Variable patterns, which bind their argument to a name

There are other types of simple patterns:

- String and Boolean literals
- Wildcard patterns, indicated with an underscore (`_`), which match any argument, and which do not bind any names.

Here are two more examples which demonstrate using these simple patterns:

```
fromString :: String -> Boolean
fromString "true" = true
fromString _      = false

toString :: Boolean -> String
toString true  = "true"
toString false = "false"
```

## Guards

In the Euclidean algorithm example, we used an `if .. then .. else` expression to switch between the two alternatives when `m > n` and `m <= n`. Another option in this case would be to use a _guard_.

A guard is a boolean-valued expression which must be satisfied in addition to the constraints imposed by the patterns. Here is the Euclidean algorithm rewritten to use a guard:

```
gcd :: Number -> Number -> Number
gcd n 0 = n
gcd 0 n = n
gcd n m | n > m = gcd (n - m) m 
gcd n m         = gcd n (m - n)
```

In this case, the third line uses a guard to impose the extra condition that the first argument is strictly larger than the second.

As this example demonstrates, guard appear on the left of the equals symbol, separated from the list of patterns by a pipe character (`|`).

## Exercises

1. (Easy) Write the factorial function using pattern matching. _Hint_. Consider the two cases zero and non-zero inputs.
1. (Medium) Look up _Pascal's Rule_ for computing binomial coefficients. Use it to write a function which computes binomial coefficients using pattern matching.

## Matching Arrays

Let's look at ways in which we can match arrays using patterns. There are two types of array pattern: array literal patterns, and cons patterns.

### Array Literal Patterns

Array literal patterns provide a way to match arrays of a fixed length. For example, suppose we want to write a function which treats empty arrays in a special way:

```
isEmpty :: forall a. [a] -> Boolean
isEmpty [] = true
isEmpty _ = false
```

Or another function which treats arrays of length five as special, binding each of its five elements in a different way:

```
takeFive :: [Number] -> Number
takeFive [0, 1, a, b, _] = a * b
takeFive = 0
```

The first pattern only matches arrays with five elements, whose first and second elements are 0 and 1 respectively. In that case, the function returns the produce of the third and fourth elements.

### Cons Patterns

Cons patterns match arrays whose length is at least one. They provide a way to separate the first element (or head) of an array, and the rest (or tail) of the array.

For example, here is a function which sums the squares in an array of numbers:

```
sumOfSquares :: [Number] -> Number
sumOfSquares [] = 0
sumOfSquares (n : ns) = n * n + sumOfSquares ns
```

This function works by separating the input into two cases: empty and non-empty arrays. If the array is empty, then the sum of squares is zero. If not, then we separate the head and tail of the array using a cons pattern, square the head element, and add it to the sum of squares of the tail.

As this example shows, cons patterns are introduced by separating two patterns with a colon: the pattern on the left of the colon matches the array head, and the pattern on the right matches the array tail.

Here is another example. This function finds the sum of all products of adjacent pairs in a list of numbers:

```
sumOfProducts :: [Number] -> Number
sumOfProducts [] = 0
sumOfProducts [_] = 0
sumOfProducts (n : m : ns) = n * m + sumOfProducts (m : ns)
```

This function splits the input into three cases: zero elements, one element, and two or more elements. In the last case, we multiply the first two elements, and recurse on the tail.

## Exercises

1. (Easy) Write a function `allTrue` which determines if all elements of an array of Boolean values are equal to `true`.
2. (Medium) Write a function which replaces the first two elements of an array of Numbers with their sum.

## Matching Records

Just as array literal patterns and cons patterns exist to deconstruct arrays, PureScript provides record patterns to deconstruct record values.

Record patterns look like record literals, but instead of colons to separate labels from expressions, record patterns use equals symbols to separate labels from patterns. For example: this pattern matches any record which contains fields called `name` and `age`, and binds their values to the names `x` and `y` respectively:

```
showPerson :: { name :: String, age :: Number } -> String
showPerson { name = x, age = y } = x ++ " (age " ++ show y ++ ")"
```

## Nested Patterns

Array patterns and record patterns both combine smaller patterns to build larger patterns. For the most part, the examples above have only used simple patterns inside array patterns and record patterns, but it is important to note that patterns can be arbitrarily nested, which allows functions to be defined using conditions on potentially complex data types.

For example, this code combines record and array patterns to match an array of records:

```
type Person = { height :: Number }

totalHeight :: [Person] -> Number
totalHeight [] = 0
totalHeight ({ height = h } : ps) = h + totalHeight ps
```

## Named Patterns

Patterns can be named to bring additional names into scope when using nested patterns. Any pattern can be named by using the `@` symbol. For example, the following code matches any array with one or more elements, but in addition to binding the head of the array to a name, the value of the array itself is bound to the name `arr`:

```
dup :: forall a. [a] -> [a]
dup arr@(x : _) = x : arr
dup [] = []
```

## Exercises

1. (Easy) Write a function which uses record patterns to find a person's city. A Person should be represented as a record which contains an `address` field of type `Address`, and `Address` should contain the `city` field.
1. (Medium) Write a function `flatten` which uses only patterns and the concatenation (`++`) operator to flatten an array of arrays into a singly-nested array. _Hint_: the function should have type `forall a. [[a]] -> [a]`.

## Case Expressions

Patterns do not only appear in top-level function declarations. It is possible to use patterns to match on an intermediate value in a computation, using a `case` expression. Case expressions provide a similar type of utility to anonymous functions: it is not always desirable to give a name to a function, and a `case` expression allows us to avoid naming a function just because we want to use a pattern.

Here is an example. This function computes longest suffix of an array which sums to zero.

```
firstZeroSum :: [Number] -> [Number]
firstZeroSum [] = []
firstZeroSum xs@(_ : t) = case sum xs of
  0 -> xs
  _ -> firstPositiveSum t
```

This function works by case analysis. If the array is empty, our only option is to return an empty array. If the array is non-empty, we first use a `case` expression to split into two cases. If the sum of the array is zero, we return the whole array. If not, we recurse on the tail of the array.

## Pattern Match Failures

If patterns in a case expression are tried in order then what happens in the case when none of the patterns in a case alternatives match their inputs? In this case, the case expression will fail at runtime with a _pattern match failure_.

We can see this behaviour with a simple example:

```
patternFailure :: Number -> Number
patternFailure 0 = 0
```

This function contains only a single alternative, which only matches a single input, zero. If we compile this file, and test in `psci` with any other argument, we will see an error at runtime:

```
$ psci

> patternFailure 10

Failed pattern match
```

Functions which return a value for any combination of inputs are called _total_ functions, and functions which do not are called _partial_.

It is generally considered better to define total functions where possible. If it is known that a function does not return a result for some valid set of inputs, it is usually better to return a value with type `Maybe a` for some `a`, using `Nothing` to indicate failure. This way, the presence or absence of a value can be indicated in a type-safe way.

Here is the `patternFailure` function, rewritten to use `Maybe Number` as the return type:

```
patternFailure :: Number -> Maybe Number
patternFailure 0 = Just 0
patternFailure _ = Nothing
```

## Algebraic Data Types

This section will introduce a feature of the PureScript type system called Algebraic Data Types (or ADTs), which are fundamentally linked with pattern matching.

However, we'll first consider a motivating example, which will provide the basis of a solution to this chapter's goal - to implement a simple vector graphics library.

Suppose we wanted to define a type to represent some simple shape types: lines, rectangles, circles, text, etc. In an object oriented language, we would probably define an interface or abstract class `Shape`, and one concrete subclass for each type of shape that we wanted to be able to work with.

However, this approach has one major drawback: to work with `Shape`s abstractly, it is necessary to identify all of the operations one might wish to perform, and to define them on the `Shape` interface. It becomes difficult to add new operations without breaking modularity. 

On the other hand, if we know the set of shape types that we want to support in advance, we can create a single `Shape` record which contains a `shapeType` field, as well as properties required by every one of the individual shape types, in the style of C unions. However, this approach has its own problem: it is not a faithful representation of a `Shape`. Every line contains properties only required for circles, and vice versa. Even if the fields were made optional using a nullable type, there would be no way for the compiler to check that the correct fields had been provided. This representation is unsafe.

Algebraic data types provide the best of both of these solutions: it is possible to define new operations on `Shape` in a modular way, and still maintain type-safety.

Here is how `Shape` might be represented as an algebraic data type:

```
data Shape
  = Circle Point Number
  | Rectangle Point Number Number
  | Line Point Point
  | Text Point String
```

The `Point` type might also be defined as an algebraic data type, as follows:

```
data Point = Point
  { x :: Number
  , y :: Number
  }
```

The `Point` data type illustrates some interesting points:

- The data carried by an ADT's constructors doesn't have to be restricted to primitive types: constructors can include records, arrays, or even other ADTs. 
- Even though ADTs are useful for describing data with multiple constructors, they can also be useful when there is only a single constructor.
- The constructors of an algebraic data type might have the same name as the ADT itself. This is quite common, and it is important not to confuse the `Point` _type constructor_ with the `Point` _data constructor_ - they live in different namespaces.

This declaration defines `Shape` as a sum of different constructors, and for each constructor identifies the data that is included. A `Shape` is either a `Circle` which contains a center `Point` and a radius (a number), or a `Rectangle`, or a `Line`, or `Text`. There are no other ways to construct a value of type `Shape`.

An algebraic data type is always introduced using the `data` keyword, followed by the name of the new type and any type arguments. The type's constructors are defined after the equals symbol, and are separated by pipe characters (`|`).

Let's see another example from PureScript's standard libraries. We saw the `Maybe` type, which is used to to define optional values, earlier in the book. Here is it's definition from the `purescript-maybe` package:

```
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
```

This example demonstrates the use of a type parameter `a`. Its definition almost reads like English: "a value of type `Maybe a` is either `Nothing`, or `Just` a value of type `a`".

Data constructors can also be used to define recursive data structures. Here is one more example, defining a data type of singly-linked lists of elements of type `a`:

```
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
```

This example is taken from the `purescript-lists` package. Here, the `Nil` constructor represents an empty list, and `Cons` is used to create non-empty lists from a head element and a tail. Notice how the tail is defined using the data type `List a`, making this a recursive data type.

## Using ADTs

It is simple enough to use the constructors of an algebraic data type to construct a value: simply apply them like functions, providing arguments corresponding to the data included with the appropriate constructor.

For example, the `Line` constructor defined above required two `Point`s, so to construct a `Shape` using the `Line` constructor, we have to provide two arguments of type `Point`:

```
exampleLine :: Shape
exampleLine = Line origin origin
  where
  origin :: Point
  origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0 }
```

To construct the `origin`, we apply the `Point` constructor to its single argument, which is a record.

So, constructing values of algebraic data types is simple, but how do we use them? This is where the important connection with pattern matching appears: the only way to consume a value of an algebraic data type is to use pattern matching to match its constructor.

Let's see an example. Suppose we want to convert a `Shape` into a string. We have to use pattern matching to discover which constructor was used to construct the `Shape`. We do so as follows:

```
showPoint :: Point -> String
showPoint (Point { x = x, y = y }) =
  "(" ++ show x ++ ", " ++ show y ++ ")"

showShape :: Shape -> String
showShape (Circle c r) =
  "Circle [center: " ++ showPoint c ++ ", radius: " ++ show r ++ "]"
showShape (Rectangle c w h) =
  "Rectangle [center: " ++ showPoint c ++ ", width: " ++ show w ++ ", height: " ++ show h ++ "]"
showShape (Line start end) =
  "Line [start: " ++ showPoint start ++ ", end: " ++ showPoint end ++ "]"
showShape (Circle loc text) =
  "Text [location: " ++ showPoint loc ++ ", text: " ++ show text ++ "]"
```

Each constructor can be used as a pattern, and the arguments to the constructor can themselves be bound using patterns of their own. Consider the first alternative of `showShape`: if the `Shape` matches the `Circle` constructor, then we bring the arguments of `Circle` (center and radius) into scope using two variable patterns, `c` and `r`. The other cases are similar.

`showPoint` is another example of pattern matching. In this case, there is only a single alternative, but we use a nested pattern to match the fields of the record contained inside the `Point` constructor.

## Exercises

1. (Easy) Construct a value of type `Shape` which represents a circle centered at the origin with radius 10.
1. (Medium) Write a function which extracts the text from a `Shape`. It should return `Maybe String`, and use the `Nothing` constructor if the input is not constructed using `Text`.

## A Library for Vector Graphics

Let's use the data types we have defined above to create a simple library for using vector graphics.

Define a type synonym for a `Picture` - just an array of `Shape`s:

```
type Picture = [Shape]
```

For debugging purposes, we'll want to be able to render a `Picture` as a string. The following function, defined using pattern matching, lets us do that:

```
showPicture :: Picture -> String
showPicture picture = "[" ++ go picture ++ "]"
  where
  go :: Picture -> String
  go [] = ""
  go [x] = showShape x
  go (x : xs) = showShape x ++ ", " ++ go xs
``` 

Notice how the recursion is handled using a helper function defined in a `where` block. The function `go` is not accessible to users of the module, only inside the function `showPicture`.

`go` handles three cases: empty arrays, singleton arrays, and anything else. This approach avoids printing an extra comma character at the end of the string.

Let's try it out. Compile your module with `grunt` and open `psci`:

```
$ grunt
$ psci

> :i Data.Picture

> showPicture [Line (Point { x: 0, y: 0 }) (Point { x: 1, y: 1 })]

"[Line [start: (0, 0), end: (1, 1)]]"
```

The example code for this module contains a function `bounds` which computes the smallest bounding rectangle for a `Picture`.

The `Bounds` data type defines a bounding rectangle. It is also defined as a algebraic data type with a single constructor:

```
data Bounds = Bounds
  { top    :: Number
  , left   :: Number
  , bottom :: Number
  , right  :: Number
  }
```

`bounds` uses the `foldl` function from `Data.Foldable` to traverse the array of `Shapes` in a `Picture`, and accumulate the smallest bounding rectangle:

```
bounds :: Picture -> Bounds
bounds = foldl combine emptyBounds
  where
  combine :: Bounds -> Shape -> Bounds
  combine b shape = shapeBounds shape \/ b
```

In the base case, we need to find the smallest bounding rectangle of an empty `Picture`, and the empty bounding rectangle defined by `emptyBounds` suffices.

The accumulating function `combine` is defined in a `where` block. `combine` takes a bounding rectangle computed from `foldl`'s recursive call, and the next `Shape` in the array, and uses a user-defined operator `\/` to compute the union of the two bounding rectangles. The `shapeBounds` function computes the bounds of a single shape using pattern matching.

## Exercises

1. (Medium) Extend the vector graphics library with a new operation `area` which computes the area of a `Shape`. For the purposes of this exercise, the area of a piece of text is assumed to be zero.
1. (Difficult) Extend the `Shape` type with a new data constructor `Clipped`, which clips another `Picture` to a rectangle. Extend the `shapeBounds` function to compute the bounds of a clipped picture. Note that this makes `Shape` into a recursive data type.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we covered pattern matching, a basic but powerful technique from functional programming. We saw how to use simple patterns as well as array and record patterns to match parts of deep data structures.

Finally, we introduced algebraic data types, a new type which is defined intrinsically in terms of pattern matching. We saw how algebraic data types allow concise descriptions of data structures, and provide a modular way to extend data types with new operations,

In the rest of the book, we will use ADTs and pattern matching extensively, so it will pay dividends to become familiar with them now. Try creating your own algebraic data types and writing functions to consume them using pattern matching.
